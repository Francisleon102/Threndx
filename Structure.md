## Threndx: Algorithmic Trading Platform

**Project Overview**
Threndx is an end-to-end algorithmic trading system designed to execute options (calls, puts) and equity trades by leveraging multi-source data ingestion, advanced analytics, graph-based models, and high-performance computing.

---

### 1. Objectives

* **Signal Generation**: Identify trading opportunities from news, social sentiment, and financial metrics.
* **High-Frequency Execution**: Optimize order placement for low-latency trading.
* **Risk Management**: Incorporate balance sheet analysis and volatility measures.
* **Scalability**: Utilize GPU acceleration and distributed systems for heavy data and model workloads.

---

### 2. Data Ingestion Layer

* **News & Social Feeds**: Chatbot interface to ingest news articles, Twitter trends, and RSS feeds.
* **Financial Data**: Automated retrieval of balance sheets, earnings reports, and market data via APIs (e.g., Alpaca, Polygon).
* **Streaming Setup**: Message broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for real-time data pipelines.

---

### 3. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

* **Text Processing**: NLP pipelines (tokenization, sentiment analysis) powered by transformer models.
* **Time Series**: Rolling statistics, technical indicators (MA, RSI, etc.).
* **Graph Construction**: Build asset relationship graphs (correlations, sector linkages) with NetworkX or DGL.

---

### 4. Modeling & Analytics

* **Graph Neural Networks**: Capture inter-asset dependencies and predict directional signals.
* **GPU Acceleration**: Use NVIDIA RAPIDS (cudf, cuML) for dataframes, feature transforms, and model training.
* **Backtesting Engine**: Modular framework to test strategies on historical data with configurable slippage and commission.

---

### 5. Execution Infrastructure

* **Order Router**: Microservice for sending orders to broker APIs.
* **Low-Latency Network**: Co-located servers or cloud instances with optimized network stack (RDMA, DPDK) for faster market access.
* **Monitoring & Logging**: Real-time dashboards (Grafana) and alerting (Prometheus).

---

### 6. Risk & Portfolio Management

* **Position Sizing**: Algorithms based on volatility, Kelly criterion, or risk parity.
* **Balance Sheet Insights**: Incorporate fundamental metrics to adjust risk thresholds.
* **Stress Testing**: Scenario analysis for extreme market moves.

---

### 7. Roadmap & Milestones

1. **MVP**: Data ingestion, basic sentiment model, backtester.
2. **GPU Integration**: Accelerate preprocessing and training with RAPIDS.
3. **Graph Models**: Develop and integrate GNN for signal generation.
4. **Execution Engine**: Deploy live trading with risk controls.
5. **Optimization**: Tune network latency, add portfolio-level optimizers.

---

### 8. Tech Stack Summary

* **Languages**: Python, C++ (performance-critical modules)
* **Frameworks**: RAPIDS, PyTorch Geometric, NetworkX, FastAPI
* **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
